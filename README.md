# Spotify playground
This application was used for Sitepoint's article [Getting Started with Underscore.js](http://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-with-underscore-js/).

It uses [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/).

The application requests artists from Spotify and renders them. The app also gets the genres from those artists and allows filtering by them.
