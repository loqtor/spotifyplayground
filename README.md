This application was used for Sitepoint's article [Getting Started with Underscore.js](http://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-with-underscore-js/).

It uses [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/).

It's a simply application which displays a list of articles and allows the user to filter by their genre.

**Update**: When clicking on an artist his albums are loaded.
